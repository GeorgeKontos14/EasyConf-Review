# README for Review Microservice 5b
Welcome to the Review microservice of team 5b. If you have any question we are always happy to answer them.

## Important note
There have been some issues in our team. Even though we started out with six team members, we now only have three left. 
The first teammate decided not to do the course in the first week. The second teammate just stopped responding to any of
our messages around the midterms and the third teammate did not even pick up a call starting January 2. As you can see 
in our git repo, none of them have contributed much to our group's work. 

We have tried our best and all things considered, we think we have held up quite well. Nevertheless, a few features 
around analytics have not been implemented and the final report may not be as thorough as you would expect from a 
complete group. We kindly ask you to keep this in mind while grading.

Naturally the Head TA has been informed shortly after these issues had arisen. There should be a note of her in our 
dossier.

## Final report
The final report was made in Overleaf, so you can find it here: [final-report.pdf](docs/final-report.pdf)

## List of final group members
These are the members of our group who finished the project
 - George Kontos
 - Tudor Chirila
 - Rein Lakerveld

## Git names
Rein Lakerveld at some point accidentally switched from his university git account to his personal git account (with the
name rainframe). Lucas Paul had the same issues, but he did not finish the project.

## Agendas, minutes and retrospectives
The agendas, minutes and retrospectives can be found [in the docs' directory](docs). The agendas are complete. Some of 
the minutes and retrospectives have sadly been lost by erroneous merges, forgetting to take notes ones, etc. There are 
however enough documents to get an idea of our work structure.
