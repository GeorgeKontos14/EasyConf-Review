- Sprint 9 review:
  - Georgios did a lot of the work for sprint 10 as well, to make sure he had time for other parts of the project
  - Tudor thought it went well, he was up to date with everything
  - Rein: I liked that we had much better communication
- Sprint 10 review:
  - Georgios: we did one endpoint per issue, which made the work per issue much more manageable and easier to review
  - Rein: I thought we could improve the reviews we give each other it the MRs
- Make sure you read and review each others report
- Today were merging dev into main. After that we'll work on the integration on a separate branch
