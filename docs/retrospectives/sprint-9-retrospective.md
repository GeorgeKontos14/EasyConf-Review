# Sprint 9 Retrospective

## State of the team
We've had a lot of issues with our team. In the first week, our first team mate dropped out. After the midterm one of the other team mates stopped responding to messages. We have discussed this with the Head TA. He's officially out of our team.

We also discussed that another team mate stopped communicating on Jan 2. He still hasn't responded to any of our messages or calls. As agreed upon with the Head TA he also is no longer part of the team.

This all means that we are left with only three people, Georgios, Tudor and Rein. Subsequently, we have had to make some adjustments to our work planning.

## Issues that have been closed
In contrast with previous sprints, we have followed the deadlines we set ourselves this time. There also was a lot of overdue work, which we caught up on. We were also quick to respond to each others messages. In the previous sprints we wanted to improve upon this, so we are happy that we did (though it might have just been that we had to)

## Taking over work of old team mates
Because two team mates were officially removed from the team, we had to redistribute some work. We took this up as an additional load this week, but it worked out well and we also finished these additional goals.

## Possible improvements for next sprint
We can be more thorough when reviewing each others MRs. When I'm busy coding I find it difficult to take enough time away for reviews and I noticed this is sometimes also the case for other team mates.

There were some miscommunications between team members where MRs got merged before they were done and where we did each other's issues accidentally. This can also be improved.
