# Sprint 10 retrospective
_For the sprint ending on January 16_

This sprint we mainly worked on improving our mutation testing, software quality and the usage of design patterns. 
Besides that we also implemented some last endpoints. 

The issues concerning the last endpoints we decided to assign one endpoint per issue. This turned out to work much 
better as the work per issue was lower.

We continued working hard on the project, and we had a lot of communication with each other, like in sprint 9. This is 
another positive for this sprint.

There are of course still improvements to be made for this sprint cycle. Personally, I think that we should be more 
thorough with the reviews of each other's merge requests. This will of course ensure better code quality and testing 
etc.
