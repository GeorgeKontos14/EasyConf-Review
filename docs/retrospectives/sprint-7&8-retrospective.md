# Sprint 7 & 8 retrospective
_For the sprint ending on December 28_

_Note this sprint retrospective was sadly lost, because I forgot to merge it. This is a reconstruction_

_Another note this is the week our team mate Pablo stopped responding to any of our messages. He was the second team 
mate in our group who did._

The work on the project was not yet on the right track. Communication between the team members was slow, one team member
was dropping out of the project, and we had difficulties with duplicated work. 

The fact that this sprint was during and just before the holidays, may have contributed to all this. After this sprint, 
we decided we wanted and needed to do better, and as you can read in following sprint retrospectives, we did improve
on these issues in the weeks after.
